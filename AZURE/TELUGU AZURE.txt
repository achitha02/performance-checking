Chemical reactions and equations
Martin H. Fisher

Consider the following situations in everyday life and think about what is going on when milk is left at room temperature in the summer.
An iron pan is placed in a humid environment.

The grapes were fermented.
Food is cooked.

Food is digested in our body.

We take a breath.

In all of the aforementioned situations, the initial nature and identity the material has changed somewhat. 
We have already learned about physics and the chemical changes of the material in our previous classes. 
when a chemical change occurs, we can say that a chemical reaction has taken place.

You may probably be wondering what actually means chemical reaction? 
How do we know that it is a chemical reaction did it happen? 
Let's do some activities to find the answer for these questions.

Beware: 
This activity is required help from the teacher. 
This would be nice if there were students wear appropriate glasses.
Clean magnesium ribbon approximately 3-4 cm by rubbing it with a layer of sand.

Hold with a pair of sticks.
Use or burn with a spirit lamp burner and ash so collect formed in a watch-glass. 
Burn the magnesium ribbon keeps it as far away as possible from your eyes.

Burning of magnesium ribbon in the air and collection of magnesium oxide in a watch glass.

Take lead nitrate solution in testing pipe.
Add Potassium iodide solution to this.
What Do You Do Notice?

Formation of hydrogen gas by reaction dilute the sulphuric acid zinc

You should note that magnesium burns with ribbon a dazzling white flame and white becomes dry. 
This powder is magnesium oxide. 
It is caused due to the reaction between magnesium and oxygen in the air.

Take some zinc granules in a conical flask or test tube.

Add diluted hydrochloric acid or sulphuric acid to this.
Caution: 
Handle acid carefully.
